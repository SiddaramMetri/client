# Academic Year Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive Academic Year functionality to the class management dashboard, including a reusable dropdown component and API integration.

## Files Created/Modified

### üÜï New API Service
- **`src/services/academicYear.service.ts`**
  - Complete API service for academic year operations
  - Includes CRUD operations, holiday management, and specialized queries
  - TypeScript interfaces for all data types

### üÜï Reusable Components

  - Props: `value`, `onChange`, `disabled`, `placeholder`, `required`, `showActiveOnly`
  - Shows active academic years with badge indicator

### üÜï Custom Hooks
- **`src/hooks/api/use-academic-years.tsx`**
  - TanStack Query hooks for academic year data fetching
  - `useAcademicYears()` - Paginated results
  - `useAllAcademicYears()` - All academic years for dropdowns
  - `useAcademicYear()` - Single academic year by ID
  - `useActiveAcademicYear()` - Get currently active academic year

### ‚úèÔ∏è Updated Class Pages
- **`src/page/dashboard/classes/create.tsx`**
  - Replaced hardcoded dropdown with dynamic AcademicYearDropdown
  - Proper form validation and error handling

- **`src/page/dashboard/classes/[id]/edit.tsx`**
  - Dynamic academic year selection with current value pre-selected
  - Maintains all existing functionality

### ‚úèÔ∏è Updated Form Components
- **`src/page/dashboard/classes/components/add-class-form.tsx`**
  - Dialog form component updated with dynamic dropdown
  - TanStack Query cache invalidation on successful creation

- **`src/page/dashboard/classes/components/edit-class-form.tsx`**
  - Dialog form component with pre-selected current academic year
  - Proper state management and validation

## Key Features Implemented

### üîÑ Dynamic Data Loading
- Academic years are fetched from `/api/academic-year` endpoint
- Cached for 5 minutes to improve performance
- Automatic retry on failure with user-friendly error messages

### ‚úÖ Form Validation
- Required field validation for academic year selection
- Zod schema validation maintained across all forms
- Proper error state handling and display

### üé® User Experience
- Loading skeletons during data fetch
- Error states with retry functionality
- Active academic year highlighted with badge
- Sorted by most recent academic year first

### üîß Developer Experience
- TypeScript strict typing throughout
- Reusable component architecture
- TanStack Query for efficient caching and state management
- Consistent API patterns

### ü§ñ Smart Auto-Selection
- **Single Option Auto-Select**: When only one academic year exists, it's automatically selected
- **Visual Feedback**: Dropdown shows "(Auto-selected)" in placeholder
- **Helper Text**: Small info text explains the auto-selection
- **Disabled State**: Dropdown is disabled when auto-selected to prevent confusion
- **Configurable**: Can be enabled/disabled via `autoSelectSingle` prop

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/academic-year?limit=100&sortBy=startDate&sortOrder=desc` - Get all academic years
- `GET /api/academic-year/active` - Get active academic year
- `POST /api/class` - Create class with academic year ID
- `PUT /api/class/:id` - Update class with academic year ID

### Data Format
```typescript
interface AcademicYear {
  _id: string;
  name: string; // e.g., "2024-25"
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  totalWorkingDays: number;
  holidays: Holiday[];
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

## Component Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```tsx
import { AcademicYearDropdown } from '@/components/form/academic-year-dropdown';

<AcademicYearDropdown
  value={selectedYear}
  onChange={setSelectedYear}
  placeholder="Select academic year"
  required={true}
  autoSelectSingle={true} // Auto-select when only one option
/>
```

### With React Hook Form
```tsx
<AcademicYearDropdown
  value={watch('academicYearId')}
  onChange={(value) => setValue('academicYearId', value)}
  placeholder="Select academic year"
  required={true}
  autoSelectSingle={true}
/>
```

### Advanced Usage
```tsx
<AcademicYearDropdown
  value={selectedYear}
  onChange={setSelectedYear}
  placeholder="Choose academic year"
  required={false}
  disabled={false}
  showActiveOnly={true} // Only show active academic years
  autoSelectSingle={false} // Disable auto-selection
  className="custom-dropdown"
/>
```

## Error Handling

### API Errors
- Network failures show retry button
- Invalid responses handled gracefully
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### Form Validation
- Required field validation
- Proper error message display
- Form submission blocked until valid

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- 5-minute stale time for academic year data
- 10-minute garbage collection time
- Query invalidation on mutations

### Loading States
- Skeleton loaders during initial load
- Disabled state during loading
- Spinner indicators for loading actions

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern React patterns (React 18+)
- TanStack Query v5
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Testing
- Created test component for validation
- TypeScript type checking
- Form validation testing
- Error state testing

## Future Enhancements
- Add academic year creation from dropdown
- Implement academic year filtering in class lists
- Add academic year management page
- Implement year-over-year analytics

## Deployment Notes
- Ensure backend academic year endpoints are available
- Verify CORS settings for new endpoints
- Test with actual academic year data
- Monitor performance with real user data

## Dependencies
- `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching
- `lucide-react` for icons
- `@/components/ui/*` for UI components
- `zod` for validation schemas
- `react-hook-form` for form management
