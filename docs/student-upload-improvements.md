# Excel Template and Student Upload Improvements 

## Problem Solved
We've fixed several issues with the student Excel template download and upload functionality:

1. Fixed the issue where clicking "Template" would trigger a request to `/api/v1/student/excel/template` that resulted in "Cannot GET" error 
2. Implemented proper Blob handling for Excel downloads
3. Added upload progress indication with percentage
4. Created proper error handling for both upload and download
5. Centralized API calls in a dedicated student service module
6. Fixed multiple type errors in the codebase
7. Created realistic mock data for testing

## Components Updated

1. `upload-students-dialog.tsx`: 
   - Added progress bar and percentage display during upload
   - Implemented proper error handling
   - Using centralized services instead of direct API calls

2. `students/index.tsx`: 
   - Updated to use the centralized student service
   - Fixed the template download functionality

## New Components Created 

1. `student.service.ts`: A centralized service for all student-related API calls
2. `progress.tsx`: A UI component for displaying progress bars
3. `mock-students.ts`: Realistic student data for development

## How to Use

### Download Student Template
Click the "Template" button on the Students page, or use the "Download Template" button in the Upload Students dialog.

### Upload Students 
1. Click the "Bulk Upload" button
2. Drag & drop your Excel file or click to browse
3. Click "Upload"
4. The progress bar will show upload status
5. Once complete, you'll see a summary of successful and failed records

## Future Improvements

1. Implement real-time progress tracking using WebSocket or Server-Sent Events
2. Add validation preview before final submission
3. Allow downloading a log of errors with detailed information
