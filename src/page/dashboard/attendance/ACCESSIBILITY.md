# Attendance System Accessibility Features

This document outlines the accessibility features implemented in the attendance system to ensure it's usable by everyone, regardless of abilities.

## Keyboard Navigation

The attendance system provides comprehensive keyboard navigation capabilities:

### Navigation Keys

- **Arrow Keys (←, →, ↑, ↓)**: Navigate between students in both grid and table views
- **Home**: Jump to the first student in the list
- **End**: Jump to the last student in the list
- **Tab / Shift+Tab**: Navigate between interactive elements (buttons, form controls)
- **Esc**: Close dialogs, dropdowns, or modals

### Status Marking Keys

- **Space / Enter**: When a student is focused, cycles through status (Present → Leave → Absent → Present)
- **P key**: Mark the focused student as Present
- **L key**: Mark the focused student as on Leave
- **A key**: Mark the focused student as Absent
